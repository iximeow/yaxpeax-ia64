## 0.2.1

* fix incorrect `yaxpeax_arch::Arch` impl for `std`-enabled builds
  (DecodeError did not implement `std::error::Error` in those build environments)

## 0.2.0

update yaxpeax-arch to 0.2.x, involving a breaking change to decode APIs (sorry)

## 0.1.4

update yaxpeax-arch to drop a dependency on termion

## 0.1.3

transpose Table 4-43 to fix decoding of `srlz.i`

add MSR load/store, `M43` interpretation, cpuid indirection

fix decoding of mov-to-PKR (table transcription error)

## 0.1.2

non-temporal hint selection (`.nt1`, `.nt2`, `.nt3`) was off by one and could panic on valid inputs
`I-Unit` operand form `I25` extension bits were incorrectly transcribed from the manual
- as a result, both `mov <reg>=ip` and `mov <reg>=pr` would decode incorrectly

## 0.1.1

actually decodeinvalid instructions.
show negative ip-relative immediates by `$-const` rather than `$+-const`.

## 0.1.0

write a decoder.
